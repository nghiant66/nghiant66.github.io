	&lt;p&gt;NYU reproducibility librarian Vicky Steeves shares why GitLab is her choice for ongoing collaborative research, and how it can help overcome challenges with sharing code in academia.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;GitLab is a great platform for active, ongoing, collaborative research. It enables folks to work together easily and share that work in the open. This is especially poignant given the problems in sharing code in academia, across time and people.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;So I'm at&lt;a href="https://scipy2017.scipy.org"&gt; SciPy2017&lt;/a&gt;¬†(I had a talk on ReproZip accepted - &lt;a href="https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/2017-SciPy/#/"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;) and I learned about some amazing open source tools for research! This year, SciPy 2017 was in Austin, Texas from July 10-16, 2017. It was the 16th annual¬†Scientific Computing with Python Conference, and focused on great new tools and methods for research with Python.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;These are my top 5 favorite takeaways from SciPy 2017!&lt;/p&gt;

There is also a map available for folks who would like to look for women leaders nearest them -- the hope is that this map makes planning conferences, workshops, and events more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;I just got back from &lt;a href="http://www.iassist2017.org/"&gt;IASSIST 2017&lt;/a&gt; and I have to say...I was very impressed! This year, IASSIST (The International Association for Social Science Information Services &amp;amp; Technology) 2017 was in Lawrence, Kansas from May 23-26, 2017. True to it's name, this conference brought people from all around the world:&lt;/p&gt;

This was my first ever peer reviewed paper and it was accepted! Not a bad first time üòÅ. Our presentation went really well -- there was good audience engagement and it seemed like there was real potential for people to extend or use our study (with all our &lt;a href="https://osf.io/zndwq/"&gt;open access data&lt;/a&gt;!). One of my favourite moments was right after our presentation, when an audience member (whose name escapes me, I'm so sorry if you're reading this!) told us that we were part of very few people he'd seen accurately use grounded theory. I doubt this is true, but it was flattering nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

After just about a year of emails, hangouts, and calls, I was excited to see the space in which I think some really innovative tech is being developed for the open X community. The second week of July was designated as SHARE week: Monday and Tuesday was the SHARE hackathon, Wednesday and half of Thursday was the SHARE community meeting, and the last half of Thursday and Friday was the SHARE Curation Associates kick off orientation. &lt;/p&gt;

Planning, executing, attending, surveying -- you name it, I've been doing it in relation to some event or another. It's actually been great, but &lt;em&gt;so exhausting&lt;/em&gt;. I am definitely giving a lot of props to event planners for doing this as their day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;So, I kind of am in love with the &lt;a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2016"&gt;FORCE conference&lt;/a&gt; I just went to. FORCE2016 is the annual conference from an organization called FORCE11 (ha, the year they started the org.). This year, 500 people came from around the world: researchers, librarians, software developers, large scale repositories, open science advocates, and everyone in between. It was not only a very diverse conference in terms of home country and job, but also in the way the conference and program was run.&lt;/p&gt;
			
			&lt;p&gt;First, one of the coolest things I have ever seen: in addition to the MULTITUDE of tweets around the event (seriously everyone was so active, it was amazing), they hired a company to take visual notes!! While everything was going on!! Everyone, the gist of their talks, panels, lightning talks, EVERYTHING! Such a great idea and it produced a great visual overview of the con!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nghiant66.github.io/blog/force-2016/"&gt;Read more‚Ä¶&lt;/a&gt; (5 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>conference report</category><category>professional development</category><guid>https://nghiant66.github.io/blog/force-2016/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 18:08:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Getting Use Cases is Hard</title><link>https://nghiant66.github.io/blog/getting-use-cases/</link><dc:creator>Nghia Ngo</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;!--

		&lt;p&gt;One of my big tasks since coming into NYU last August was to work on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/reprozip"&gt;ReproZip&lt;/a&gt; project. My role is largely outreach and education: I was tasked with teaching ReproZip and general reproducibility principles, gathering use cases in a wider variety of disciplines (when I arrived, the use cases were largely in computer science), and supporting users in general.&lt;/p&gt;
				
		&lt;p&gt;ReproZip kind of blew my mind when I arrived; it's an open source software tool that simplifies the process of creating reproducible experiments. Basically it tracks operating system calls and creates a package that contains all the binaries, files, and dependencies required to reproduce the experiment. A reviewer can then extract the experiment on their own machine using ANY operating system (even if it's different from the original one!!) to reproduce the results. As a librarian, I was like "OH MY GOD. THE DIGITAL PRESERVATION GAME JUST GOT UPPED." Anyway, here's basically how ReproZip works -- in 2 steps:&lt;/p&gt;
