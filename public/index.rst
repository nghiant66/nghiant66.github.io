    <h3> Research Interests </h3>

    <p> I am working on problems related to Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Specifically, my current main research focuses are cross-domain information extraction and multilingual language understanding. In addition, I am interested in novel approaches from different fields such as Adversarial Learning,  Optimal Transport, Meta Learning, etc to address the problem of low-resource learning </p>
